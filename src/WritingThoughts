As of right now, I'd like to have a generic domain/repo/services
    1. Controller is where I'd want to have the ability to search against
        "https://www.cryptonator.com/api/currencies" with a user input of a specific TICKER
        ===Each crypto has a specific ticker (as show on the URL above)===
        -- then grab that info and run it against... :
            google? / Cryptonator?
            1a. Hopefully run it against something to grab that data and create a URL Cyrptonator can read
                so I can access their data
            2a. This is a example request for simple info on BTC (bitcoin)
                -e.g.  https://api.cryptonator.com/api/ticker/btc-usd

            1b. Assuming everything works out to plan, having one domain class with the raw information
                given on the Cryptonator link provided (https://www.cryptonator.com/api/),
                I should be able to achieve this as long as all of the other links have the
                same HTTP concept of
                    - https://www.cryptonator.com/api/ticker/{TICKER}-{TARGET}

            2b. I can then display the given information every 5 minutes with a nice .toString and
                great formatting


    2. Potential blockers BEFORE RESEARCH -> updating every 5 minutes (maybe include that in main...but
        how without hard restarting the app everytime?
        -> running user input for new URLs against Cryptonator API
        -> why would i need to have a CRUD Update? unless that can run directly a
            "DELETE" into a "CREATE" with the given ticker?
        -> multiple Cryptos being displayed at once
        -> where to display them? H2? Just Postman?
            -> Find a free online domain and format it with JS?
